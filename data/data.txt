The priority input must be an integer between -20 (high priority) and 19 (low priority).
Due to differences between Unix priority levels and Windows priority classes, priority is mapped to one of six priority constants in os.constants.priority.
When retrieving a process priority level, this range mapping may cause the return value to be slightly different on Windows.
To avoid confusion, set priority to one of the priority constants.
